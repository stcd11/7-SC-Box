* Building the box
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- It's time to start manufacturing your box.
- Before you start, it would be worth checking out the [[Badge It]] section at the end of this page, as you're badge will depend on the care and precision with which you assemble the box.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Before you start, use the web to identify and describe some different types of glue that can be used to bond wooden surfaces.
- Write up your findings in a table in your portfolio.
** Build It - The base
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- The finished box should look like this.
[[file:img/Box_1.JPG]]
- Check that you have all the correct MDF parts.
[[file:img/1_Box.jpg]]
- We'll start by assembling the base of the box.
[[file:img/2_Box.jpg]]
- Here's how the parts of the base will fit together.
[[file:img/3_Box.jpg]]
- You'll apply the PVA Glue using the tip of your finger.
[[file:img/4_Box.jpg]]
- Prepare the base by afixing masking tape as shown below. This will help fix the parts in place once you start glueing.
[[file:img/5_Box.jpg]]
- Apply the PVA to the edge of the back part. Don't use too much.
[[file:img/6_Box.jpg]]
- Fit the parts together.
[[file:img/7_Box.jpg]]
- Then use the masking tape to hold it in place.
[[file:img/8_Box.jpg]]
- Repeat this procedure to glue together the sides and front of the base.
[[file:img/9_Box.jpg]]
- Before the glue dries, make sure you clean it away from the corners of your box.
[[file:img/10_Box.jpg]]
** Build It - The locking mechanism
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Next we'll assemble the locking mechanism.
[[file:img/11_Box.jpg]]
- We need to line up the mechanism first. Take your box base.
[[file:img/12_Box.jpg]]
- Then fit the upright part of the mechanism into the hole.
file:img/13_Box.jpg
- Use a pencil to mark where the circular part needs to fit.
file:img/14_Box.jpg
- It should now look like this
file:img/15_Box.jpg
- Now glue the mechanism together.
file:img/16_Box.jpg
- Wait for it to dry and clean off the glue. Then use glass paper to shave off the corner as shown below
file:img/17_Box.jpg
file:img/18_Box.jpg
file:img/19_Box.jpg
- Then glue the mechanism into the box base as shown.
file:img/20_Box.jpg
file:img/21_Box.jpg
file:img/22_Box.jpg
** Build It - The lid
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Next we'll assemble the lid.
file:img/23_Box.jpg
- Using the same method as before, assemble and glue the lid together, cleaning off the glue once you have finsihed.
file:img/24_Box.jpg
- Next glue the inner parts of the lid into place.
file:img/25_Box.jpg
- It should now look like this. Give your parts at least *40 minutes* to dry.
file:img_26_Box.jpg
** Build It - Finishing off
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Use sand paper to gently sand the external faces of your box.
file:img/27_Box.jpg
- Now get some M3x12 machine screws and M3 nuts.
file:img/28_Box.jpg
- The machine screws will fit into the sides as shown below, but at the moment they will not sit /flush/ to the surface of the box.
file:img/29_Box.jpg
- Use a /Countersink Cutter/ to create a /countersink/ around the 3mm hole.
file:img/30_Box.jpg
- Now the machine screw should sit in the hole and be flush with the surface.
file:img/31_Box.jpg
- Use pliers and a screwdriver to screw the lid into place.
file:img/32_Box.jpg
- Lastly, get some polystyrene and place it in yout box to hold loose components.
