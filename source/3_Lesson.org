- Now that you've had some experience dimensioning and trimming Solidworks sketches, we're going to create a sketch of our own.
** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Here is a picture of the piece we're trying to make.
[[file:img/Box_Lid_Front.jpg]]
1. Open up Solidworks and create a new file.
[[file:img/sketch_1.png]]
1. Choose the option to make a =Part=.
2. Click =OK=.
[[file:img/sketch_2.png]]
1. We're going to start off with a rectangle. Find the rectangle tool in the toolbar and click the small arrow to the right of it. This will bring up a context menu, allowing you to choose different types of rectangle.
2. We want to use the =Centre Rectangle=
[[file:img/sketch_3.png]]
1. Now Solidworks will ask you to choose which =Plane= you want to start your sketch in. We'll choose the =Top Plane= by clicking on it.
[[file:img/sketch_4.png]]
1. If you want to change your view at any time, you can use the view tool bar at the top of the screen.
2. It'll be easiest if we're in the =Top= view.
[[file:img/sketch_5.png]]
1. Now, this next part is important. You need to start drawing your rectangle in the centre of the 3D environment. You should see a pair of arrows indicating the =origin=. This is where the rectangle should start.
[[file:img/sketch_6.png]]
1. Don't worry about the size of the rectangle. Just drag it out to any size. Then use the =Smart Dimentsion= tool you used in the last lesson to set the rectangle's dimensiions, as shown below
[[file:img/sketch_7.png]]
1. Your sketch should be =Fully Defined= at the moment.
2. Next we'll add some finger joints.
3. This time we want to use the =Corner Rectangle=
[[file:img/sketch_8.png]]
1. Add rectangles as shown below. Make sure that each Rectangle starts being draw on the lines of the large rectangle in the middle.
2. You should see small green symbols. The first one shown means a point is =coincident= to a line. This is the same as saying it is touching the line.
3. The second green symbols shown indicate that two lines are =Vertical=
[[file:img/sketch_9.png]]
1. Now that the finger joints have been added, we need to dimension them. Add dimensions so that your sketch is fully defined, like the one below.
[[file:img/sketch_10.png]]
1. We now need to add a cut out in our main shape.
2. Use the centre rectangle tool to draw a rectangle /near/ to the center of the large rectangle.
3. Dimension it so that is is 3mmx12mm and 6mm from the top.
[[file:img/sketch_11.png]]
1. Now we want to position the small rectangle in the /Horizontal/ centre of the large rectangle.
2. Click on the middle of the large rectangle, then hold down the /Shift Key/ and click on the centre of the small rectangle.
[[file:img/sketch_12.png]]
1. Now from the context menu on the left of the screen, choose to add a =Vertical= relationship.
2. Click the green tick. This will now ensure that the two rectangles are vertically aligned.
[[file:img/sketch_13.png]]
1. Your sketch should now be fully defined and look like the image below.
2. Trim the finger joints next.
[[file:img/sketch_14.png]]
1. Exit your sketch.
[[file:img/sketch_15.png]]
1. Now extrude the sketch by 3mm to make your finished part. Save it as *Lid-Box-Front*.

  1. Look at the sketch below.
  2. You need to draw, trim and fully define this sketch.
  3. Once you have completed that, extrude it by 3mm
  4. Take a screen shot of the full defined sketch and the 3d part for your portfolio.

  1. Find the part that looks like the image below.
  2. Use a pair of calipers to measure the dimensions of the part carefully.
  3. Use SolidWorks to create your own sketch of the part and take a screenshot of it for your portfolio.
  4. Extrude the sketch to produce a 3D part and capture a screenshot for your portfolio.
