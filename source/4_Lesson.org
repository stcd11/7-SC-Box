- In SolidWorks, an assembly is a collection of 3D parts.
- Just like sketches, assemblies need to be fully defined, so that the distances between parts are known by the software,
- To accomplish this we use =mates=.
- This is the assembly we're going to make.
[[file:img/front-base-back.jpg]]
** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Open up SolidWorks.
- Create a new document.
- This time, we're going to choose an =Assembly=
[[file:img/Assembly_1.png]]
- Click on Browse and find the Base part you made in a previous lesson.
[[file:img/Assembly_2.png]]
- If you struggle to find your parts, or they have not been made correctly, then you can use the ones linked here.
[[file:doc/box_base.SLDPRT][Box Base]]  
[[file:doc/box_back.SLDPRT][Box Back]]  
[[file:doc/box_front.SLDPRT][Box Front]]  
- Once the part has been imported, click in the view port to place the part.
[[file:img/Assembly_3.png]]
- Next we need to insert the Box-Back into our assembley.
- Click on the =Insert Components= button in the tool bar and then select your Box-Back part.
[[file:img/Assembly_4.png]]
- You can now move the part around and get an approximate position to place it. Don;t worry about being accurate here.
[[file:img/Assembly_5.png]]
- Now we need to rotate the part into an approximation of it's correct orientation.
- Select the box_back part.
[[file:img/Assembly_6.png]]
- Next
  1. Click on the =Move Component= button
  2. Click on the =Rotate Component= option from the contect menu.
[[file:img/Assembly_8.png]]
- Now you can rotate the part into the correct orientation. Again, you don't need to be accurate here. Just position the piece so that the finger joints are pointing downwards.
[[file:img/Assembly_9.png]]
- Now the process of mating can begin.
- Mating involves matching =faces= that are =coincident= with each other. This can mean they are either touching each other (as if glued together) or perfectly inline with each other. Usually you'll need *3* mates to fully define the position of any part. This will lock the part on the X, Y and Z axis.
- Select the inner face of the back of the box.
[[file:img/Assembly_10.png]]
- Now change your view so that you can see the reverse side of the assembley and use the =SHIFT KEY= to click and select the inner face of either of the finger joints on the base of the box.
[[file:img/Assembly_11.png]]
- Now click the =Mate= button from the toolbar
[[file:img/Assembly_12.png]]
- The software will default to a coincident relationship, so we can just click the green tick.
[[file:img/Assembly_13.png]]
- That's one mate completed and two more to go.
- Select the lower face of one of the finger joints of the back of the box, and use the shift key to also select the lower face of the base.
[[file:img/Assembly_14.png]]
- Now mate the two parts again.
- Lastly we need to select the matching faces of the finger joints of bothe the back and base part.
[[file:img/Assembly_15.png]]
- Mate the parts and you should see that your assembley has been fully defined.

** Badge It - Silver
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- To earn the Silver *Best Mate* badge
  1. Import the [[file:doc/box_front.SLDPRT][front of the box]].
  2. Mate it to the base so that your assembly is fully defined.
  3. Screen shot your assembly for your portfolio.
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- To earn the Gold *Best Mate* badge
  1. Import the [[file:doc/box_side.SLDPRT][side part of the box]].
  2. Mate this part correctly and then import it again and mate it on the other side.
  3. You should now have a completed box that is missing a lid.
** Badge It - Platinum
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- To earn the Platinum *Best Mate* badge
  1. Import the remaining parts one at a time and mate them together to form a completed box.
     - [[file:doc/box_back.SLDPRT][Box Back]]
     - [[file:doc/box_back.SLDPRT][Box Base]]
     - [[file:doc/box_front.SLDPRT][Box Front]]
     - [[file:doc/box_side.SLDPRT][Box Side]]
     - [[file:doc/lid_front.SLDPRT][Lid Front]]
     - [[file:doc/lid_side_inner.SLDPRT][Lid Side Inner]]
     - [[file:doc/lid_side_outer.SLDPRT][Lid Side Outer]]
     - [[file:doc/lid_top.SLDPRT][Lid Top]]
  2. You might need your teacher's assistance to mate the lid parts to the box body.
  3. You should now have a completed box.
