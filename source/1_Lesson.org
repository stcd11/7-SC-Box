- Over the course of this year, you are going to be manufacturing numerous electronic and mechanical products.
- To prevent loss or damage to your work, the outcome of this project is to produce an MDF box that you can use to store your work.
- The aims of this project are:
  1. To introduce you to Computer Aided Design (CAD)
  2. To introduce you to Laser Cutting
  3. To intorduce you to 3D manufacturing.

- To hold our projects for the year our box is going to need to meet the following criteria:
  1. Be no smaller than 150mm x 150mm x 150mm
  2. Cost no more than £2
  3. Must be stackable

- Before we start any project we should always try and see what is already available on the market.
- Use the web to see if you can find a couple of boxes that might be suitable.
** Document It

:END:
- You'll need to find images and use their =URLs= in your document. Ask your teacher if you're not sure how to do this.
- You'll need to list advantages and disadvantages of the boxes.
- Here's an example of what your document should look like.

- We need to pick a suitable material from which to produce our box.
- The material must meet the following criteria
  1. Cost no more than £7 per square metre
  2. Can be cut on a laser cutter
  3. Can withstand mild bumps and knocks

- Use the web to find a suitable material to use for your box.
- Here are some materials that you might like to research:
  - Aluminium
  - Acrylic
  - MDF
  - Balsa wood
  - Cardboard
  - Steel
  - HIPs

- *Silver:* Find three different storage boxes online, and identify at least one advantage and disadvantage of each. 
- *Gold:* Find images of and describe properties of two different materials you could use to make a storage box. 
- *Platinum*: Complete the above two tasks, including additional detail (E.g. Another material, additional advantages and disadvantages of boxes, etc)
