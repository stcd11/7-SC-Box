* Defining and Trimming Solidworks sketches
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- We're going to use a program called Solidworks to design our box.
- Solidworks is a 3D CAD program
- You'll get lots of experience with Solidworks later on in the year, so for this section of the project, you'll just be creating a couple of the Solidworks parts and assembling them.
- In Solidworks you start by creating a *2D sketch*. You can then convert this to a *3D part*. You can then join parts together to make a *3D assembly*.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- In Solidworks you have to ensure all your drawings are *fully defined*.
- This means that the software must know the dimensions of *every* line you draw.
- Quite often the software is able to work out a dimension of a line, from others you have provided.
- Look at the diagrams below. They have all been *fully defined*. Try and calculate the value of the missing dimensions labeled. You can add the dimensions to the Portfolio.md.

- Below is a photograph of the parts we're going to design using Solidworks.
- Notice the finger-joints on each part.
[[file:img/Base_and_Front.jpg]]
- [[file:doc/box_base_undefined.SLDPRT][Download this file ]]and then open it in Solidworks. This is the unfinished sketch of the base.
** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Let's add some dimensions to the drawing you've opened in SolidWorks.
- Use the dimension tool to add the missing dimensions as shown in the image guide below.
- When you are finished, your drawing should be *fully defined*.
[[file:img/Dimensioning_1.png]]
  1. Make sure the =Sketch= tab has been selected.
  2. You'll see that the sketch has not yet been fully defined.
  3. Click on the =Smart Dimension= tool from the tool bar.
[[file:img/Dimensioning_2.png]]
  4. Click the top line of the sketch and drag upwards a little.
  5. Release the mouse button and you should see the dimension has been added.
  6. This dimension should be 165mm so we can just click the green tick.
[[file:img/Dimensioning_3.png]]
  7. Now let's dimension the far right hand line in the same way. It should be 60mm.
[[file:img/Dimensioning_4.png]]
  8. Now we'll dimension the space between the finger-joint and the edge of the base. Click on the far left line.
  9. Now click on the left-hand side of the finger-joint as shown.
  10. Drag upwards to position the dimension marker and click.
  11. This dimension is incorrect so change it to 25mm and then click the green tick.
[[file:img/Dimensioning_5.png]]
  12. Do the same with the right hand finger-joint.
  13. Your sketch should be fully defined.

:END:
- To finish off this sketch, we need to do some triming.
[[file:img/Trim_1.png]]
  1. Click on the trim tool in the toolbar.
[[file:img/Trim_2.png]]
  2. From the context menu on the left of the screen, make sure =Trim to closest= has been selected.
[[file:img/Trim_3.png]]
  3. Now your cursor should now be displaying a scissor icon. Click on the upper line as shown in the diagram above. You will need to click twice to remove the line completely.
[[file:img/Trim_4.png]]
  4. You're sketch should now look a little like the one above.
[[file:img/Trim_5.png]]
  1. Use the trim tool to fashion the remaining finger-joints of the base.
  2. Take a screen shot of your finished sketch for your portfolio.
[[file:img/Trim_6.png]]
  6. Some of the joints might be difficult to see, but if you click on the =Exit Sketch= button, then you'll see a clear drawing of your sketch.

:END:
- To turn a sketch into a part, we need to extrude it.
[[file:img/Extrude_1.png]]
  1. Click the =Features= tab to get the 3D tool bar.
  2. Click on =Extruded Boss/Base=.
[[file:img/Extrude_2.png]]
  3. In the context menu on the left, change the Depth to 3mm, as this is the thickness of the MDF we are using.
  4. Click the green tick to carry out the extrusion
  5. Your part should now be complete, so take a screenshot for your portfolio.

** Badge It - Silver 3D Designer

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Now let's see if you can dimension, trim and extrude a sketch on your own.
- [[file:doc/box_front_undefined.SLDPRT][Download this file]] and open it in Solidworks.
- Here is the finished sketch that you need to create, showing all the relevant dimensions.
[[file:img/Box_front.png]]
- When you have finsihed the sketch, you'll need to extrude it by 3mm.
- Take screenshots of your finished sketch and part and then add them to your Portfolio.
